I am a mathematics researcher focusing on the intersection of mathematical analysis, abstract algebra, and their applications to theoretical physics and quantum mechanics.

Research Interests
======
My research is centered around these main areas:

* **Mathematical Analysis**: Functional analysis, operator theory, and spectral theory with applications to quantum systems.
* **Abstract Algebra**: Group theory, representation theory, and algebraic structures in quantum information science.
* **Mathematical Physics**: Rigorous mathematical approaches to quantum theory, quantum field theory, and related areas.

I am particularly interested in developing new mathematical frameworks for understanding quantum systems, using techniques from functional analysis and algebra to address fundamental questions in theoretical physics.
